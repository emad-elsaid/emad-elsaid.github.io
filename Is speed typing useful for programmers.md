The following tries to answer the title question. and to make sure it's clear. The following are questions that are **not** answered in this page:
- Is speed typing the most important skill for programmers?
- Should I be faster in typing at my current programming skill?
- Should a beginner learn speed typing?
- How fast should I be until I hit the point of maximum return?
- Do I have to speed type to be a good programmer?

To answer the question we need a plan, a chain of reasoning to link speed  typing to programmers, here is a chain I will follow:
- Define speed typing, and programmers to make sure we're talking about the same thing
- Research the cost/effort of speed typing
- Research the benefits of speed typing on different activities
- Draw a conclusion based on cost/benefits
