#devices

:joystick: I got my steam deck 21-September-2022 as my 34th birthday gift. 

* The steam deck I got was the 512GB version. 
* It came with a hard case, microfiber cloth, a charger and a pouch bag for the charger.

# Games 

I played several games on it and I noticed that it's easier decision to buy a game after I got it.

* Portal 2
* The witcher 3
* Dead cells
* Hades
* Cup head
* TMNT
* Skul
* Vampire surivors
* Brotato
* Celeste
* Yakuza 0

# Build

Material and build quality feels very good. it also feels good in the hand more like a PS4 controller feeling than xbox controller.

# Performance 

* Some games really get on it's nerves, the witcher 3 for example. the fan kicks in after couple minutes of gameplay
* Some games plays really smooth and doesn't make it sweat. Dead cells for example.
* I tried to install an epic game from the desktop mode "Nioh" and it struggled with it and the experience awful it didn't regognize the correct controller layout even. so I stuck to steam games.
* I got to install google chrome and play youtube videos which were cool.

# Game library

It felt good that I got a game on steam deck and also played it on my PC. I got TMNT and then found that it can be played split screen so it felt good that I could just run the same game with the same save history to let my wife join on a bigger screen.

# Issues

+ On 4-Feb-2023 the device audio sounded weird after exiting Skyrim. I restarted it and it got stuck on the logo after booting. the recovery system can't start too.
+ I contacted Steam support, the helped with troubleshooting
  + The first troubleshooting was to try to get into BIOS by powering on + pressing the volume up (+) and that works but still didn't solve the problem
  + The second step was to put it in "Battery shipping mode" from the BIOS power menu and leave it a couple of minutes  and then connect it to power. that solved the issue.
  
* On end of 2024 the device battery was drained after I stopped using it for a couple of months. 
  * Charging it and turning it on didn't turn on the screen. but I heard the chim sound and vibrating indicating it started
  * Trying external monitor didn't work either
  * Tried contacting the support and they suggesting holding `-` and `...` and power button. that didn't work
  * The suggested another solution `+` and power button. that didn't work either
  * The last suggestion is that it's a specific issue and it's been too long since I bought it so I have to pay for the repair which is not less than 200eur. 
  
I guess I'm getting a Nintendo switch 2 when it comes out then :shrug:
