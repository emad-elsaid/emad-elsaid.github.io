#manga #book

* A Korean Manga. and Anime on CrunchyRoll
* It's printed and also readable from https://www.solo-leveling-manhwa.com/
* The website is mobile friendly So no need to large screen

# Notes
* It's enjoyable to read and the power fantasy for the character is pretty nice.
* For someone who like RPG games it's also relatable
* The story is a little shallow and the characters are under developed
* The Drawing is also good quality however it lacks details like other proper manga
