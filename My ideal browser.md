* No tabs bar. No title bar. No Address bar. No status bar. No bars. Just the web page in the whole window.
* No tabs. Blends the concept of an open page and closed pages (History) together. there is no difference. You can switch to a page you visited before in an instant. and you can reload it if you want. if it doesn't exist anymore it shows you the latest version loaded. It's not ok to visit a page you bookmarked and it doesn't exist anymore and you can't get the one you loaded before.
* It Should solve its own memory and CPU usage. I don't need to babysit it by closing some tabs for the machine to get faster. It should use the machine to deliver the experience optimally. Save to disk. compress data. suspend the page. whatever don't get me into technicality. I'm here to browse web pages not to solve your existential performance issues
* I should be able to fuzzy search page titles/URLs to switch back to any page I opened before. ordered by recent pages.
* All visited pages should be indexed and I should be able to search locally the contents of any pages I opened before.
* Search images in pages by content.
* Should be programmable. I don't need artificial limits. I should be able to override any part of this browser and extend it with a sane programming language.
* Videos transcribed and saved. and searchable. like any other content.
* No app store. just users writing their own packages/extensions or whatever you call them. and share it with each other. No big brother trying to save the little kids using their browser kind of bullshit.
