## Peer To Peer

I developed an interest in decentralization technologies and #p2p  solutions. these are some ideas that occupied my mind for a while: 

- Distributed authority product features for future of distributed applications
- A general idea of a peer to peer social network
- Follow up on peer to peer social media network solution
- Sound approach for a p2p social network which falls back to current web
- what are we sharing
