According to the following guide 

https://youtu.be/L0igr0tf4Ik

Same as the standard format with the following modifications: 
* Build a storyboard by:
  * Choose a Legendary character as your "Main character"
  * Choose an "Ally" character as your "Ally character" - Can't be the same card as the Main character
  * Choose a song card that your Main character can sing
* The past 3 cards are put in the "storyboard area"
* You can use up to 3 ink colors instead of 2
* The deck total cards is 100 = (3 storyboard + 97 card)
* Only one copy is allowed in the deck instead of 4
* Every time a storyboard card is used, banished, gets back to your hand, or added to your ink well, you may choose to put it back to the storyboard area
* Every time a storyboard card is put back into the storyboard, a "Tax counter" is increased
* You can play a storyboard card in your turn by paying the cost of the card + the tax
* The tax does not increase the shift cost
* The first user reaching 30 lore wins instead of 20

Banned from storyboard: 
* A whole new world
* Be prepared
