According to the [following guide](https://youtu.be/L0igr0tf4Ik)

Same as the standard format with the following modifications: 
* Choose Legendary character as you "Main character"
* Choose an "Ally" character as your "Ally character"
* Choose a song card that your Main character can sing
* The past 3 cards are put in "storyboard area"
* You can use 3 ink instead of 2
* The deck total cards is 100 including the 3 past characters
* Only one copy is allowed in the deck instead of 4
* Every time a storybord card is banished or gets back to your hand or forced to get into your ink well you may choose to put it back to the storyboard area
* Everytime a storyboard card is put back to the storyboard a "Tax counter" is increased
* You can play a storyboard card in your turn by paying the cost of the card + the tax
* Shift cost is not increased by the tax

Banned from storyboard: 
* A whole new world
* Be prepared
