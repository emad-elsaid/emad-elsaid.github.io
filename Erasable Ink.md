A couple of days ago I got a new pen. I wanted to write some notes and I passed by a book store that sells these cute pens

I noticed it has a little writing that says: "Erasable Pen"

The last time I have seen erasable ink was when I was a child and it was an eraser that was too hard it takes a layer of paper to erase. But this one made me curious

I noticed the eraser on the back of this pen is doesn't seem to dissolve when used. so that means it doesn't work like other erasers used for pencils

I googled it to find the produce page says that it's a "heat sensitive ink"

And on wikipedia turns out there is a page for this ink: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermochromic_ink

**The ink turns transparent when heat is applied, it's not erased :smile:**

Here is a short video for it:

That was an interesting little learning for my day :smiley:
