The advances in AI in the past couple of years. specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) raised many concerns about safety, future of human society and impact on all aspects of life.

The fear stems from the fast acceleration in the development of AI in comparison to the biological evolution of the human race. which concludes that humans contribution to society would be insignificant compared to the abilities AI system will have in the next couple of years.

It drives everyone to think of restricting the AI system's abilities by banning AI weapons, reducing LLMs' abilities to contribute to specific sensitive topics or the alignment with humanity's goals. Basically, everyone is afraid of waking up one day and their roomba on their bed with a knife remote controlled by a malignant AI that reached a conclusion that humans are irrelevant to their goals.

And the problem with this picture we painted is that it assumes the future has to have two sides, Humans vs. AI. which makes it a zero sum game when trying to find a safe future for both sides. So the conversations sways always to taking actions to give humans advantages over the other side of the equation.

The conversation becomes fundamentally different if we imagine a future where AI and humans are integrated into a singular being. Accelerating human biology, and accelerating AI capabilities at the same time. Leading to a future where both sides become one side and adding abilities to both benefit society

To reach such a future. Several breakthroughs have to be achieved. A completely offline AI so that when integrated with human biology it keeps the biological autonomy. And faster human-to-computer/AI interface to make sure the flow of data between the biological part and the silicon part is as fast as possible. And finally, legal advancement to classify the new species with several specific legal frameworks in the humanity transition phase between old and new biology.

In this future the AI is confined to human biology. making the AI systems contribute to the thinking process, generating ideas, faster processing or digestion of ideas. and the human body is responsible for execution in the physical world. making each and every human responsible for the AI part of their body instead of one company dictating the model safety for all its users.
