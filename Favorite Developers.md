The following is a list of developers that deserve to be followed and supported. I believe so because they have one of more of the following traits:

- They are writing code, have hands on experience in coding projects
- The projects they worked on are visible and prooved their success
- They are not following hypes and have a personal perspective to how to do things
- I personally like their line of thinking and what they stand for
- They have deep low level knowledge of how software works
