Lets say you're a company that makes a photo editing application. Imagine it as
a startup that tries to create an alternative for Adobe Photoshop.

Work for me is creating the software itself. that's what the company sells. so
everyone in the team should be contributing to this end artifact. That's what
solely matters the freaking thing you're selling.

In reality that's not the only thing people in the company are doing of course.
You'll find also people doing work that facilitate work for the actual people
doing work. Like creating/closing chat channels on Slack or Hipchat or whatever
people are using to communicate what they're doing. Or inventing meetings to
"coordinate" between people doing work to make sure they're "aligned" and people
monitoring other people doing work and measuring their performance and reviewing
their work for quality. That's what I will call from now on "Meta Work" it's not
an actual work that contributes to the end product. it's work that adjust the
actual work that produce the end product.

Then there is other work like training people to give proper feedback. or making
talks and events to make sure people know the policies for creating
documentation pages that include policies about the organization. or Making
meetings with people doing meta work to make sure they're doing their meta work
correctly and properly. That as you expect can be named "Meta Meta work".

The rabbit hole is as deep as you can dig really. in some organization you can
find Meta Meta Meta work where someones time is spent on deciding which
organization will get a contract to offer training on how to make policies or
creating meetings effectivly in an organization. You see what I'm getting at?

This is a plague. And I'm not exaggerating. This is one of the reasons startups
fail to deliver a solution that actually work. Have you ever used a software and
asked yourself: "Why this simple feature doesn't exist?" or "Why the hell can't
do this simple thing in this software?" One of the reasons is that meta work. It
overshadow the actual work. eating the time of the actual people doing work.

Contrary to the common perception of what developer time is used for, Coding is
not the highest consumer of time. Developers spend most of their time doing
meeting and attending internal talks and review meetings and planning meeting
and other types of meetings.

The more a developer loves coding the more I see an annoyance on his face when a
meeting starts. There are people who actually picked up this career to write
code and develop solutions but instead they found themselves in a hole full of
meeting with nothing but a thin agenda and zero reason to exist in any of them.
