# last activity
+ Mau project

# Current activity
+ Reviewing the implementation

# Base of the idea
+ Social media is people talking to each other in the digital space
+ and it should adhere to the same rules for people talking in real life

# Problem
+ Accelerate innovation: photographers Exif data and example
+ Walled garden: I would like to share my videos once to appear on all my social applications
+ Censorship: especially at the times of large conflicts
+ Ads
+ Algorithm
+ Control
+ Data travels over the internet although there is no need for that
+ Data leak
