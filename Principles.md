List of principles to remind me of what I believe in

* Self Dicipline
  * If I decided to achieve a goal I have to control myself in order to achieve it
  * It's ok to change goals. but if the decision is to have this goal then being lazy about it is not an option
  * Helping book: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldiaiDt1w9g
* Tell the truth
  * If I can't tell the truth don't lie
  * It's easier on the brain to be truthful
  * Lying requires remembering the lies to continue the narrative
  * So it's simpler to just tell the truth
* Eat to live
  * It's ok to enjoy some food.
  * I don't live to eat. eating is not a goal it's a mean to live.
  * When you're not hungry anymore stop eating. It doesn't matter if the plate is not empty
* Don't be in debt
  * Don't buy anything unless you have the money to buy it many times
  * Don't buy unless you need to
  * Excess money can be used to buy things you want (not need)
  * Pay yourself first
* Money is not a goal
  * The goal is to be able to make money when I want to fulfill my needs.
  * Spending money on investing in yourself raises your value. and in effect your ability to make money.
  * Investing in yourself is the highest investment you can do in life and it's never a losing investment.
* Be the best version of yourself
  * That means I don't compare myself to others. It's depressing.
  * Look up to others for inspiration not comparison.
  * Emad today should be better than yesterday and tomorrow better than today.
* Being a good person
  * Being a good person in the general sense is not an easy principle.
  * You can't be a good person for everyone, but you can be a good person for a large number of people
  * The goal is to maximize the number of people that consider you a good person.
